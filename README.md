University course assignment to model **5-fold cross validation** using the supervised classification algorithm LVQ in Matlab

[`lvqdata.csv`](lvqdata.csv) is the dataset used, containing 100 two-dimensional feature vectors, 50% belonging to class 1 and 50% to class 2.

The algorithm uses LVQ to optimise the positions of k randomly initialized prototypes. Each prototype or set of prototypes per class is trained for up to 100 epochs. In order to evaluate learning performance M-fold cross validation is used. This is a resampling procedure that splits our given data into training and testing data. The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated on an error metric which determines the accuracy of the model. In order to avoid a big difference among accuracy of test and training data, the data is split into folds, in this case it is split into 5 folds, and each time the data is split we ensure that a different fold is used as testing data.
